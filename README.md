This repository contains the open code for our article Advancing Preeclampsia Prediction: A Tailored Machine Learning Pipeline for Handling Imbalanced Medical Data

Preeclampsia is a significant challenge in obstetrics, where early and accurate prediction is crucial for timely intervention. However, the development of predictive models is often hindered by the class imbalances commonly found in clinical data. This study aims to address this issue by developing a robust pipeline that enhances the predictive performance of ensemble machine learning models for the early detection of preeclampsia. We systematically evaluated combinations of six ensemble machine learning algorithms and eight resampling techniques across various minority-to-majority ratios. Our results highlight the importance of strategic optimization, with the most effective configuration employing the Inverse Weighted Gaussian Mixture Model for resampling, coupled with the Gradient Boosting Decision Trees algorithm, achieving a Geometric Mean of 0.6694. This optimized approach significantly outperformed baseline models across all metrics, demonstrating substantial improvements in handling imbalanced datasets. The findings underscore the importance of careful variable optimization in medical diagnostics, offering potential applications in other medical contexts where class imbalance is a critical concern.
